Description



The National Intelligence Council of Nation X receives a piece of credible information that Nation Y will send spies to steal Nation X’s confidential paper. So the commander of The National Intelligence Council take measures immediately. 
He will investigate people who will come into Nation X. At the same time, there are two List in the Commander’s hand, one is full of spies that Nation Y will send to Nation X, and the other one is full of spies that Nation X has sent to Nation Y before. There may be some overlaps of the two list. Because the spy may act two roles at the same time, which means that he may be the one that is sent from Nation X to Nation Y, we just call this type a “dual-spy”. So Nation Y may send “dual_spy” back to Nation X, and it is obvious now that it is good for Nation X, because “dual_spy” may bring back Nation Y’s confidential paper without worrying to be detention by Nation Y’s frontier. So the commander decides to seize those that are sent by Nation Y, and let the ordinary people and the “dual_spy” in at the same time .So can you decide a list that should be caught by the Commander?


A: the list contains that will come to the Nation X’s frontier.
B: the list contains spies that will be sent by Nation Y.
C: the list contains spies that were sent to Nation Y before.

Input


There are several test cases.
Each test case contains four parts, the first part contains 3 positive integers A, B, C ( A, B, C are all less than 1000), and A is
the number which will come into the frontier. B is the number that will be sent by Nation Y, and C is the number that Nation X has
sent to Nation Y before. The second part contains A strings, the name list of that will come into the frontier. The third part 
contains B strings, the name list of that are sent by Nation Y. The fourth part contains C strings, the name list of the “dual_spy”. 
There will be a blank line after each test case. 
There won’t be any repetitive names in a single list, if repetitive names appear in two lists, they mean the same people.


Output


Output the list that the commander should caught (in the appearance order of the lists B).if no one should be caught, then , you should output “No enemy spy”.
